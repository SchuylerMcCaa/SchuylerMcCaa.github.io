       One of the first organized team sports I competed in was basketball. I joined never having played before in seventh grade, and it was a wonderful experience. I was on a team with all of my friends and it was so much fun. It was not so focused on making sure we were the best, but actually on having fun. Our team won the whole championship season, and came home with the first place trophy. The second year I managed to get a hang of the sport and was one of the team leader by the end of the year. I worked really hard to get better, and by the end of the year I managed to become one of the best players. My team also managed to win the championships that year as well! I have not played on a basketball team since, but it was a good experience while it lasted!

      Another sport I competed in was shot put. I had never heard of the sport before I tried it, but I soon learned that I was not half bad at doing it. I worked really hard with the shot put coach to improve, and progressively began to do better in competition. I ended up scoring second place in the championships. The next year I kept up the hard work and also tried a little discus. I did even better distance wise that year, but kept my spot in second place for the championships. I plan to pick up the sport again, I feel like I was fairly good at it and enjoyed it too.
